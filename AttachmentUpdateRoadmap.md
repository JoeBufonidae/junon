attachment update roadmap

2. Attachment Slot System 
Suit Slot Limits:
Different suits have varying numbers of attachment slots.

Tier System
Tier 1,2,3: Craftable with items attainable on home sector
Tier 4: Craftable with rare event items
Tier 5: Found very rarely on event maps
Warning: Care must be taken to prevent players from skipping tier 4 and tier 5s becoming more common than t4. The average player should use t3 and competitive players should have access to tier 4. Tier 5 attachments should be only for the most advanced and experienced players and should be extremely valuable and desired. Having a maxed out tier 5 armor should be possible but should be so extremely rare as to be nearly impossible in practice. This is the best of the best.
